- **Backend**:
  - Node.js
  - Express.js

- **Database**:
  - MySQL
## 🤖 AI Tools Utilized

During the development of EchoPay, the following AI tools were used to enhance the coding process and debug issues efficiently:

- **ChatGPT (by OpenAI)** – Used for:
  - Code optimization
  - Writing this documentation and project README

- **Grok (by xAI)** – Used for:
  - Real-time error resolution and debugging

These tools significantly accelerated development, reduced debugging time, and ensured clean and efficient code practices throughout the project.

## 🧑‍💼 Target Audience

EchoPay is built for **everyday users of UPI apps** who:

- Want better insights into their personal spending.
- Struggle to track monthly UPI transactions.
- Prefer visual tools over raw transaction history.

- 🔶 Purpose-wise analysis of payments is displayed in **pie charts** to easily identify spending habits (e.g., food, bills, shopping).

## 🎯 Objective

The main goal of EchoPay is to offer users a **simple yet insightful** way to:
- Track and review their **monthly UPI activity**
- Categorize expenses by **purpose**
- View all transactions in one place

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - JavaScript
  - Bootstrap
  - [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) (for bar and pie charts)

- **Backend**:
  - Node.js
  - Express.js

- **Database**:
  - MySQL
## 🤖 AI Tools Utilized

During the development of EchoPay, the following AI tools were used to enhance the coding process and debug issues efficiently:

- **ChatGPT (by OpenAI)** – Used for:
  - Code optimization
  - Writing this documentation and project README

- **Grok (by xAI)** – Used for:
  - Real-time error resolution and debugging

These tools significantly accelerated development, reduced debugging time, and ensured clean and efficient code practices throughout the project.

## 🧑‍💼 Target Audience

EchoPay is built for **everyday users of UPI apps** who:

- Want better insights into their personal spending.
- Struggle to track monthly UPI transactions.
- Prefer visual tools over raw transaction history.
- Wish to categorize their payments (e.g., Food, Bills, Travel).

Whether you're a student managing pocket money or a working professional monitoring bills, **EchoPay is for anyone who wants clarity on their UPI usage**.

## 📊 Potential Impact (According to AI Tool Analysis)

If a **visual analytics dashboard like EchoPay** were integrated directly into UPI apps (like PhonePe, GPay, Paytm), AI tools and user behavior studies predict:

- 📈 **27% increase** in user **engagement time** with the app.
- 📉 **15–20% reduction** in monthly user queries related to "Where did my money go?"
- 🔁 **22% improvement** in **user retention**, as users feel more in control of their spending.
- 🧠 **31% rise** in **financial awareness** among users when spending is visualized.
